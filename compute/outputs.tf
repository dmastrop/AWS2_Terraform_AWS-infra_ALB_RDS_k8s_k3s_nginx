#     # NOTE in older terraform versions, since we are outputting everything from the compute aws_instance and using in root/outputs.tf
#     # to display in terminal, this throws and erro and requires the following line here (and in root/outputs.tf) to avoid the error:
    
#     sensitive = true
    
#     # in later and current terraform version these sensitive output values are automatically tagged and this line is not required!!!

# this next block is for appending the instance port (in this case tg_port which is 8000) to the output in root/outputs.tf for the 
# instance ip: port. The format should be like   "aws2_node-14503" = "44.234.252.19:8000‚Äù

    # this will export the port used for the target group attachment. Note that we use [0] which is the port assigned to the first EC node instance
    # this is because [1] node will have the same port anyways. So we can us [0].port for both "instance_port" on both nodes!!!
